# Aquashow Park Hotel

Site: [https://aquashowpark.com/](https://aquashowpark.com/)

This website is for an aquapark with an attached hotel. The site primarily features a denim color 
scheme and is built using WordPress (which is evident from the HTML code). 
 
The site serves as an informational portal with limited user logic. However, it does have support 
for user accounts, which initially confused me as I couldn't find the "log in" or "registration" 
buttons anywhere. They are only displayed during the ticket purchasing process. 
 
## The main page

### Header with contact information
 
The header displays contact phone numbers. It would be better if the phone numbers were 
made clickable by using an anchor tag with a "tel:" href. 
 
### Navigation bar
The navigation bar features a logo indicating that the hotel has a 4-star rating (which is a good 
thing to highlight). It also includes a dropdown menu with a clear and simple hierarchy, a 
language selector offering 3 language options, and an action button in the top right corner. 
 
Defect: When users open a non-main page, they lose the navigation menu, which is only 
displayed on the main page. This can make navigation a little difficult. 
 
### Slider
The first slide provides promotional information, while the rest of the slides only display 
pictures. It would be better to include more compelling information that answers the question, 
"why should someone visit this park?" This is especially important considering that the discount 
for online purchasing is duplicated below the slider. 
 
Below the slider, there is a booking menu that appears simple and informative. 
 
### Body
The body section features 6 buttons corresponding to different sections of the site, each with 
big pictures and some mouse-hovering animations. 
 
 The only concern here is the inclusion of the "Job Offers" button, as it is not relevant to 
customers. It would be better to place it in the footer instead. 
 
### Announcement
This section lacks any design and was probably added after the site went live. 
 
### Map
A thin and elegant strip displays a Google Map showing the location of the park. 
 
### Footer
The footer includes contact information, links to technical pages, the address, and social media 
links. 
 
## Other Pages

Informative Pages  
* Food and Drinks 
* Attractions 
* Shows 
* Maps 
* Etc. 
 
There are approximately 20 informative pages that provide information about the park. These 
pages do not include any user-side logic and solely present details about various aspects of the 
park. 
 
### Gallery
 This page features a photo grid. There is a separate page for each section of the site, including 
the aquapark, indoor park, and hotel. It might be more efficient to have a single page with 
dynamic switching between the different galleries. 
 
### Ticket Purchasing Page
 This is the only page that incorporates client-side logic. The first step involves a calendar where 
users can select a date. After choosing a date, users can specify the number of tickets they want 
to purchase and proceed with the buying process. 
 
## Summary
Despite its outdated design and a few minor shortcomings, the aquapark website is highly 
informative and provides all the necessary information, which should be the primary goal of 
any theme park site.
